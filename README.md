<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository contains the final project for the Model-Based Software Development lecture at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. It implements a simple IMP in Go and provides helper functions to create abstract syntax trees (ASTs), which represent expressions, statements, or a combination of both as programs which then can be pretty printed, evaluated and type checked. For project details, please refer to the original project requirements of the lecture.

This project is based on the given code by Prof. Sulzmann.
